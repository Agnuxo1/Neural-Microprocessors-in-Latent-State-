Abstract

This paper explores the concept and potential applications of neural microprocessors operating in a
latent state. These advanced processors utilize neural network architectures to achieve higher
efficiency and performance in various applications. We discuss the current state of technology,
including recent advancements in 1-bit neural network training, and provide a comparative analysis
with traditional microprocessors.

Introduction

Neural microprocessors represent a significant advancement in the field of artificial intelligence (AI)
and computing. Unlike traditional processors that rely on fixed architectures and binary logic, neural
microprocessors leverage the adaptive and dynamic nature of neural networks to perform complex
computations more efficiently.
Current State of Technology

The integration of neural networks into microprocessor design has opened up new possibilities for
optimizing performance and energy efficiency. One of the most promising techniques is the use of
1-bit neural networks, which significantly reduce the computational and memory overhead.
1-bit Neural Network Training
Recent research, such as the work on BitNet b1.58, has demonstrated the feasibility of training
large language models (LLMs) with weights constrained to ternary values {-1, 0, 1}. This approach
not only matches the performance of full-precision models (FP16 or BF16) but also offers
substantial improvements in latency, memory usage, throughput, and energy consumption.

Performance and Energy Efficiency
The adoption of 1-bit neural networks in BitNet b1.58 has led to significant performance
improvements. For models exceeding 3 billion parameters, BitNet b1.58 matches the perplexity
and end-task performance of FP16 models while requiring substantially less memory and latency.

Methodology
The core methodology involves the use of quantization techniques to reduce the precision of
weights and activations in neural networks. This process involves scaling the weight matrix by its
average absolute value and rounding each element to the nearest ternary value. This significantly
reduces the computational load and enhances energy efficiency.
